# Overview

This is a console-based task management application that allows users to create, manage, and persist tasks through the CLI. The application demonstrates core TypeScript concepts including classes with inheritance, generic types, async file operations, recursive functions, and comprehensive error handling with type safety.

The purpose for writing this software was to gain hands-on experience with TypeScript's type system beyond basic usage and explore the following:
- How static typing prevents runtime errors
- How classes and interfaces create better code organization
- How TypeScript's async/await syntax improves upon JavaScript's promise handling.

This project serves as a practical demonstration of moving from JavaScript to TypeScript development.
